# Numeral Ping
A Fabric mod to show the ping of each player in the tab list. Inspired by [Numeric Ping](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/numericping), but updated to 1.18 and has some config options.

This is a pretty small mod: I created the mod and this repository in less than 3 hours.
